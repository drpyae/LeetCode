    "We can solve this problem both recursively and iteratively:\n",

    "   - A tree is symmetric if the left subtree is a mirror reflection of the right subtree.\n",

    "### Explanation\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Recursive Approach**:\n",
    "   - A helper function `isMirror` is used to compare the left and right subtrees recursively.\n",
    "   - The function checks if the current nodes are symmetric and proceeds to check their children nodes in a mirrored fashion.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Iterative Approach**:\n",
    "   - A queue stores pairs of nodes to compare.\n",
    "   - Nodes are dequeued and compared; their children are enqueued in the mirrored order to ensure symmetric comparison.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Complexity\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Time Complexity**: \\( O(N) \\), where \\( N \\) is the number of nodes in the tree, as every node is checked once.\n",
    "- **Space Complexity**: \\( O(N) \\), due to the recursive stack or queue used in the iterative approach.\n",
    "\n",
    "Both approaches effectively check whether the tree is symmetric around its center."
