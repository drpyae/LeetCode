    "To solve this problem, we need to find the first occurrence of the substring `needle` in the string `haystack`. If `needle` is found, we return the starting index of its first occurrence; otherwise, we return `-1`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Approach:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Check Lengths**:\n",
    "   - If the `needle` is an empty string, by definition, the first occurrence is at index `0` of `haystack`.\n",
    "   - If the length of `needle` is greater than the length of `haystack`, it can't be a substring of `haystack`, so return `-1`.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Sliding Window Technique**:\n",
    "   - Use a sliding window of length equal to `needle` over the `haystack` to check for matches.\n",
    "   - Iterate through `haystack` up to `len(haystack) - len(needle) + 1` (inclusive) to avoid out-of-bounds errors.\n",
    "   - For each position `i` in `haystack`, check if the substring `haystack[i:i + len(needle)]` matches `needle`.\n",
    "   - If a match is found, return the index `i`.\n",
    "   - If no match is found after iterating through `haystack`, return `-1`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Python Implementation:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def strStr(self, haystack: str, needle: str) -> int:\n",
    "    # Edge case: If needle is an empty string, return 0\n",
    "    if not needle:\n",
    "        return 0\n",
    "    \n",
    "    # Edge case: If needle is longer than haystack, it can't be found\n",
    "    if len(needle) > len(haystack):\n",
    "        return -1\n",
    "\n",
    "    # Sliding window technique to find the first occurrence of needle in haystack\n",
    "    for i in range(len(haystack) - len(needle) + 1):\n",
    "        # Check the substring of haystack from i to i + len(needle)\n",
    "        if haystack[i:i + len(needle)] == needle:\n",
    "            return i\n",
    "\n",
    "    # If no match is found, return -1\n",
    "    return -1\n",
    "```\n",
    "``` python\n",
    "class Solution:\n",
    "    def lengthOfLastWord(self, s: str) -> int:\n",
    "        end = len(s) - 1\n",
    "        while s[end] == \" \":\n",
    "            end -= 1\n",
    "        start = end\n",
    "        while start >= 0 and s[start] !=\" \":\n",
    "            start -= 1\n",
    "        return end - start         \n",
    "### Example Usage:\n",
    "```\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Example 1\n",
    "haystack1 = \"sadbutsad\"\n",
    "needle1 = \"sad\"\n",
    "print(strStr(haystack1, needle1))  # Output: 0\n",
    "\n",
    "# Example 2\n",
    "haystack2 = \"leetcode\"\n",
    "needle2 = \"leeto\"\n",
    "print(strStr(haystack2, needle2))  # Output: -1\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Explanation of Examples:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Example 1**:\n",
    "   - Input: `haystack = \"sadbutsad\"`, `needle = \"sad\"`\n",
    "   - The substring `\"sad\"` first occurs at index `0`.\n",
    "   - Output: `0`\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Example 2**:\n",
    "   - Input: `haystack = \"leetcode\"`, `needle = \"leeto\"`\n",
    "   - The substring `\"leeto\"` does not occur in `\"leetcode\"`.\n",
    "   - Output: `-1`\n",
    "\n",
    "### Complexity Analysis:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Time Complexity**: \\(O(n \\times m)\\), where `n` is the length of `haystack` and `m` is the length of `needle`. In the worst case, we may have to check all possible substrings of length `m` in `haystack`.\n",
    "- **Space Complexity**: \\(O(1)\\), as we are not using any additional space except for a few variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Note:\n",
    "This solution uses a basic approach to solve the problem. For larger inputs or more optimized solutions, advanced string matching algorithms such as the **Knuth-Morris-Pratt (KMP)** algorithm or **Rabin-Karp** can be considered to achieve a time complexity closer to \\(O(n + m)\\)."
