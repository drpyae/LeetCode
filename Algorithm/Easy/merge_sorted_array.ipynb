    "To solve the problem of merging two sorted arrays (`nums1` and `nums2`) into one sorted array in `nums1` without using extra space, we can utilize a two-pointer approach starting from the end of the arrays. This approach works efficiently in O(m + n) time.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Approach:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Initialize Pointers**:\n",
    "   - Use three pointers: \n",
    "     - `p1` pointing to the last element of the meaningful part of `nums1` (i.e., `m - 1`).\n",
    "     - `p2` pointing to the last element of `nums2` (i.e., `n - 1`).\n",
    "     - `p` pointing to the last element of `nums1` (i.e., `m + n - 1`), where the final merged array will be stored.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Merge from the End**:\n",
    "   - Start filling `nums1` from the end (position `p`) by comparing elements from `p1` and `p2`.\n",
    "   - Place the larger of the two elements at position `p`.\n",
    "   - Decrease the pointer of the array from which the element was taken and also decrease `p`.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Copy Remaining Elements**:\n",
    "   - If there are remaining elements in `nums2` that haven't been copied (if `p2 >= 0`), copy them to `nums1`.\n",
    "   - No need to copy elements from `nums1` because they are already in place if `p1 >= 0`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Implementation:\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's the code that implements this approach:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class Solution:\n",
    "    def merge(self, nums1: List[int], m: int, nums2: List[int], n: int) -> None:\n",
    "        # Pointers to the end of the actual elements in nums1, nums2, and the end of nums1\n",
    "        p1 = m - 1\n",
    "        p2 = n - 1\n",
    "        p = m + n - 1\n",
    "        \n",
    "        # While there are elements to be considered in both nums1 and nums2\n",
    "        while p1 >= 0 and p2 >= 0:\n",
    "            # Place the larger element at the end of nums1\n",
    "            if nums1[p1] > nums2[p2]:\n",
    "                nums1[p] = nums1[p1]\n",
    "                p1 -= 1\n",
    "            else:\n",
    "                nums1[p] = nums2[p2]\n",
    "                p2 -= 1\n",
    "            p -= 1\n",
    "        \n",
    "        # If there are remaining elements in nums2, copy them\n",
    "        # If there are remaining elements in nums1, they are already in place\n",
    "        nums1[:p2 + 1] = nums2[:p2 + 1]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Explanation of the Code:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Pointers Initialization**:\n",
    "   - `p1` starts at the last element of the first part of `nums1`.\n",
    "   - `p2` starts at the last element of `nums2`.\n",
    "   - `p` starts at the last index of `nums1`.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Merging Process**:\n",
    "   - Compare `nums1[p1]` with `nums2[p2]` and place the larger element at position `p`.\n",
    "   - Move the respective pointers backward and continue until all elements from `nums2` are placed.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Copy Remaining Elements**:\n",
    "   - If `p2` still has elements left, copy them to the beginning of `nums1`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example Execution:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example 1:\n",
    "- Input: `nums1 = [1,2,3,0,0,0], m = 3, nums2 = [2,5,6], n = 3`\n",
    "- Output: `nums1 = [1,2,2,3,5,6]`\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Start: `p1 = 2, p2 = 2, p = 5`\n",
    "2. `nums1[p] = max(3, 6) -> 6`, update pointers `p2 = 1, p = 4`\n",
    "3. `nums1[p] = max(3, 5) -> 5`, update pointers `p2 = 0, p = 3`\n",
    "4. `nums1[p] = max(3, 2) -> 3`, update pointers `p1 = 1, p = 2`\n",
    "5. `nums1[p] = max(2, 2) -> 2`, update pointers `p2 = -1, p = 1`\n",
    "6. Copy any remaining elements: `nums1 = [1, 2, 2, 3, 5, 6]`\n",
    "\n",
    "### Complexity:\n",
    "- **Time Complexity**: O(m + n) because we iterate through both arrays once.\n",
    "- **Space Complexity**: O(1) as we modify `nums1` in place.\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach efficiently merges the two arrays without needing additional space, making it optimal for the given constraints."
