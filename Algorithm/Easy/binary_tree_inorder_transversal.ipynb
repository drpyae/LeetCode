    "To perform an inorder traversal of a binary tree, we visit the nodes in the following order:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Traverse the left subtree.\n",
    "2. Visit the root node.\n",
    "3. Traverse the right subtree.\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach ensures that we visit the nodes in a left-root-right sequence, which results in a sorted order for Binary Search Trees (BSTs).\n",

    "### Python Solution\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's a Python implementation of an inorder traversal using both recursive and iterative methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Recursive Approach\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Definition for a binary tree node.\n",
    "class TreeNode:\n",
    "    def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):\n",
    "        self.val = val\n",
    "        self.left = left\n",
    "        self.right = right\n",
    "\n",
    "class Solution:\n",
    "    def inorderTraversal(self, root: TreeNode) -> list[int]:\n",
    "        def inorder(node):\n",
    "            if not node:\n",
    "                return\n",
    "            inorder(node.left)\n",
    "            result.append(node.val)\n",
    "            inorder(node.right)\n",
    "        \n",
    "        result = []\n",
    "        inorder(root)\n",
    "        return result\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Iterative Approach Using Stack\n",
    "\n",
    "The iterative approach uses a stack to traverse the tree without recursion.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class Solution:\n",
    "    def inorderTraversal(self, root: TreeNode) -> list[int]:\n",
    "        result, stack = [], []\n",
    "        current = root\n",
    "        \n",
    "        while current or stack:\n",
    "            # Reach the leftmost node of the current node\n",
    "            while current:\n",
    "                stack.append(current)\n",
    "                current = current.left\n",
    "            \n",
    "            # Current must be None at this point\n",
    "            current = stack.pop()\n",
    "            result.append(current.val)\n",
    "            \n",
    "            # We have visited the node and its left subtree. Now it's right subtree's turn\n",
    "            current = current.right\n",
    "        \n",
    "        return result\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example Usage\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's an example of how you can use these methods:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Constructing the binary tree:\n",
    "#        1\n",
    "#         \\\n",
    "#          2\n",
    "#         /\n",
    "#        3\n",
    "\n",
    "root = TreeNode(1)\n",
    "root.right = TreeNode(2)\n",
    "root.right.left = TreeNode(3)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Inorder traversal should return [1, 3, 2]\n",
    "sol = Solution()\n",
    "print(sol.inorderTraversal(root))  # Output: [1, 3, 2]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Explanation\n",
    "- **Recursive Approach**: It uses a helper function `inorder` that recursively visits left, root, and then right nodes.\n",
    "- **Iterative Approach**: It uses a stack to traverse the tree in a controlled manner, mimicking the call stack of recursion.\n",
    "\n",
    "Both approaches will give you the correct inorder traversal of the binary tree. Let me know if you need further clarifications!"
