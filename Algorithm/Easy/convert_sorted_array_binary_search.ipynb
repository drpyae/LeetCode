    "To convert a sorted integer array into a height-balanced binary search tree (BST), we can use a divide-and-conquer approach. A height-balanced BST is defined as a binary tree in which the depth of the two subtrees of every node never differs by more than one.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Approach\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Divide and Conquer**:\n",
    "   - The middle element of the array will be the root of the BST because it provides a balanced division of the array into two halves.\n",
    "   - Recursively, the left half of the array will form the left subtree, and the right half will form the right subtree.\n",
    "   - This approach ensures that the BST remains balanced, as each subtree is built from an equally divided portion of the array.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Steps**:\n",
    "   - Find the middle index of the array.\n",
    "   - Create a tree node with the value of the middle element.\n",
    "   - Recursively apply the same logic to the left and right subarrays.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Implementation\n",

    "### Explanation\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Recursive Building**:\n",
    "   - The function `buildBST(left, right)` is called recursively to build the tree.\n",
    "   - `mid = (left + right) // 2` finds the middle element, which becomes the root of the current subtree.\n",
    "   - The left subtree is constructed from elements to the left of `mid`, and the right subtree is from elements to the right of `mid`.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Output Representation**:\n",
    "   - The function `level_order_traversal` helps to visualize the tree by printing the tree in level-order format, with trailing `None` values removed for readability.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Complexity\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Time Complexity**: \\( O(N) \\), where \\( N \\) is the number of elements in the array since each element is visited once.\n",
    "- **Space Complexity**: \\( O(\\log N) \\) for the recursion stack in the case of a balanced tree. In the worst case (skewed tree), it could be \\( O(N) \\).\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach efficiently converts the sorted array into a balanced BST, maintaining the properties of both the BST and the height balance."
