    "To solve the problem of finding the path with the maximum probability of success in an undirected weighted graph, we can use a modified version of Dijkstra's algorithm, which typically finds the shortest path in terms of distance. In this case, we will adjust it to find the path with the maximum probability.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Approach\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Graph Representation**: Represent the graph using an adjacency list where each node is connected to its neighboring nodes along with the probability of success on that edge.\n",
    "2. **Priority Queue**: Use a priority queue (or max-heap) to explore paths with higher probabilities first, ensuring that we are always expanding the path with the current maximum probability.\n",
    "3. **Dijkstra-like Expansion**: Starting from the `start` node, update the probability of reaching each neighboring node. Continue this process until reaching the `end` node or exhausting all possibilities.\n",

    "### Explanation of the Code\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Graph Representation**: We build an adjacency list where each entry contains the neighboring nodes and the probability of reaching them.\n",
    "2. **Priority Queue**: The priority queue (`max_heap`) stores tuples of `(-probability, node)` to simulate a max-heap using Python's `heapq` which is a min-heap by default.\n",
    "3. **Probability Updates**: For each node popped from the queue, the algorithm updates the probabilities of reaching its neighbors. If the new probability of reaching a neighbor is greater than any previously recorded probability, it updates that neighbor's probability and adds it to the queue.\n",
    "4. **Termination**: If the end node is reached, the current probability is returned. If the queue is exhausted without reaching the end node, the function returns 0.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Complexity\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Time Complexity**: \\( O(E \\log V) \\), where \\( E \\) is the number of edges and \\( V \\) is the number of vertices.\n",
    "- **Space Complexity**: \\( O(V + E) \\) due to the adjacency list and priority queue.\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach efficiently finds the path with the maximum success probability, even for large graphs with up to \\(10^4\\) nodes and \\(2 \\times 10^4\\) edges."
