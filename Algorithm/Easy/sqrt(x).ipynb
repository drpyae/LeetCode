    "To find the square root of a non-negative integer `x` rounded down to the nearest integer without using built-in exponentiation functions or operators, we can use the **binary search** approach. This approach ensures that the solution is efficient with a time complexity of \\(O(\\log x)\\).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Explanation\n",
    "\n",
    "The idea is to use binary search to find the integer part of the square root of `x`.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Define the Search Range**:  \n",
    "   The square root of a number `x` will be between `0` and `x` (inclusive). We set `left` to `0` and `right` to `x`.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Binary Search**:  \n",
    "   - Compute the middle of the range: `mid = (left + right) // 2`.\n",
    "   - Check if `mid * mid` is equal to `x`. If it is, `mid` is the square root, and we return `mid`.\n",
    "   - If `mid * mid` is less than `x`, it means the square root is greater than `mid`, so we set `left = mid + 1`.\n",
    "   - If `mid * mid` is greater than `x`, it means the square root is less than `mid`, so we set `right = mid - 1`.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Terminate when the Range is Narrowed Down**:  \n",
    "   The loop continues until `left` exceeds `right`. When the loop ends, `right` will be the largest integer whose square is less than or equal to `x`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Python Code\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is the implementation of the binary search approach:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def mySqrt(x: int) -> int:\n",
    "    if x < 2:\n",
    "        return x  # The square root of 0 or 1 is itself\n",
    "\n",
    "    left, right = 0, x\n",
    "\n",
    "    while left <= right:\n",
    "        mid = (left + right) // 2\n",
    "\n",
    "        # Check if mid squared is equal to x\n",
    "        if mid * mid == x:\n",
    "            return mid\n",
    "        elif mid * mid < x:\n",
    "            left = mid + 1\n",
    "        else:\n",
    "            right = mid - 1\n",
    "\n",
    "    # Right will be the integer part of the square root when left > right\n",
    "    return right\n",
    "```\n",

    "#### Example 1\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Input**: `x = 4`\n",
    "- **Process**:\n",
    "  - `left = 0`, `right = 4`\n",
    "  - `mid = (0 + 4) // 2 = 2`\n",
    "  - `2 * 2 = 4`, which is equal to `x`\n",
    "  - Return `2`\n",
    "- **Output**: `2`\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example 2\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Input**: `x = 8`\n",
    "- **Process**:\n",
    "  - `left = 0`, `right = 8`\n",
    "  - `mid = (0 + 8) // 2 = 4`\n",
    "  - `4 * 4 = 16`, which is greater than `8`, so `right = 3`\n",
    "  - `mid = (0 + 3) // 2 = 1`\n",
    "  - `1 * 1 = 1`, which is less than `8`, so `left = 2`\n",
    "  - `mid = (2 + 3) // 2 = 2`\n",
    "  - `2 * 2 = 4`, which is less than `8`, so `left = 3`\n",
    "  - `mid = (3 + 3) // 2 = 3`\n",
    "  - `3 * 3 = 9`, which is greater than `8`, so `right = 2`\n",
    "  - Now, `left > right`, loop exits, and `right` is `2`\n",
    "- **Output**: `2`\n",
    "\n",
    "### Complexity Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Time Complexity**: \\(O(\\log x)\\) because we are using binary search.\n",
    "- **Space Complexity**: \\(O(1)\\) since we are using a constant amount of additional space.\n",
