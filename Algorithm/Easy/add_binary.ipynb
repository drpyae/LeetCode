    "To solve the problem of adding two binary strings, we can take a step-by-step approach, simulating how binary addition works.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Binary Addition Rules\n",
    "\n",
    "- **0 + 0 = 0**  \n",
    "- **0 + 1 = 1**  \n",
    "- **1 + 0 = 1**  \n",
    "- **1 + 1 = 10** (which is 0 with a carry of 1)\n",
    "\n",
    "If there is a carry left over after the addition of the last bits, it should also be included in the final result.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Approach\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Initialize Variables**:\n",
    "   - Use pointers `i` and `j` to keep track of the current position in each string `a` and `b`, starting from the end (the least significant bit).\n",
    "   - Use `carry` to keep track of any carry from the addition of two bits.\n",
    "   - Use `result` to accumulate the binary result.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Iterate Through the Strings from Right to Left**:\n",
    "   - Start a loop from the end of both strings until all characters have been processed (including any remaining carry).\n",
    "   - Convert the characters from both strings to integers and compute the sum along with the carry.\n",
    "   - Determine the new digit to append to the result and update the carry.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Handle Remaining Carry**:\n",
    "   - After processing all characters, if there is any carry left, append it to the result.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Reverse the Result**:\n",
    "   - Since the result was built from least significant to most significant bit, reverse it to get the correct binary sum.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Python Code\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is the Python code implementing the approach:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def addBinary(a: str, b: str) -> str:\n",
    "    i, j = len(a) - 1, len(b) - 1  # Start from the end of both strings\n",
    "    carry = 0  # Initialize carry\n",
    "    result = []  # List to store the result bits\n",
    "\n",
    "    # Process both strings from right to left\n",
    "    while i >= 0 or j >= 0 or carry:\n",
    "        # Convert the current bits to integers and add them along with the carry\n",
    "        sum = carry\n",
    "        if i >= 0:\n",
    "            sum += int(a[i])\n",
    "            i -= 1\n",
    "        if j >= 0:\n",
    "            sum += int(b[j])\n",
    "            j -= 1\n",
    "\n",
    "        # Append the result bit to the result list\n",
    "        result.append(str(sum % 2))  # Add the last bit of the sum (either 0 or 1)\n",
    "        carry = sum // 2  # Update the carry (either 0 or 1)\n",
    "\n",

    "    - No more bits in both `a` and `b`, but carry is `1` → result: `100`\n",
    "- **Output**: `\"100\"`\n",
