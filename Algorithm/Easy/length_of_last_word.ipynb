    "To solve this problem, we need to find the length of the last word in the given string `s`. A word is defined as a maximal substring consisting of non-space characters.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Approach:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Trim the String**:\n",
    "   - Remove any leading or trailing spaces in the string `s` using the `strip()` method. This helps eliminate any unnecessary spaces that could affect our result.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Split the String into Words**:\n",
    "   - Use the `split()` method to split the trimmed string by spaces. This method returns a list of words (substrings separated by spaces).\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Find the Last Word**:\n",
    "   - The last word in the list can be accessed using `words[-1]` (the last element of the list).\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Return the Length of the Last Word**:\n",
    "   - Return the length of the last word using the `len()` function.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Python Implementation:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def lengthOfLastWord(s):\n",
    "    # Trim the string to remove leading and trailing spaces\n",
    "    s = s.strip()\n",
    "\n",
    "    # Split the string into words\n",
    "    words = s.split()\n",
    "\n",
    "    # Return the length of the last word\n",
    "    return len(words[-1])\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example Usage:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Example 1\n",
    "s1 = \"Hello World\"\n",
    "print(lengthOfLastWord(s1))  # Output: 5\n",
    "\n",
    "# Example 2\n",
    "s2 = \"   fly me   to   the moon  \"\n",
    "print(lengthOfLastWord(s2))  # Output: 4\n",
    "\n",
    "# Example 3\n",
    "s3 = \"luffy is still joyboy\"\n",
    "print(lengthOfLastWord(s3))  # Output: 6\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Explanation of Examples:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Example 1**:\n",
    "   - Input: `s = \"Hello World\"`\n",
    "   - The last word is `\"World\"` with a length of `5`.\n",
    "   - Output: `5`\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Example 2**:\n",
    "   - Input: `s = \"   fly me   to   the moon  \"`\n",
    "   - After trimming, the string becomes `\"fly me   to   the moon\"`.\n",
    "   - The last word is `\"moon\"` with a length of `4`.\n",
    "   - Output: `4`\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Example 3**:\n",
    "   - Input: `s = \"luffy is still joyboy\"`\n",
    "   - The last word is `\"joyboy\"` with a length of `6`.\n",
    "   - Output: `6`\n",
    "\n",
    "### Complexity Analysis:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Time Complexity**: \\(O(n)\\), where `n` is the length of the string `s`. The split operation and trimming both traverse the string once.\n",
    "- **Space Complexity**: \\(O(n)\\), since the `split()` method may create a list of words that, in the worst case, could be as long as the input string `s`.\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach is straightforward and efficient for the given problem constraints."
