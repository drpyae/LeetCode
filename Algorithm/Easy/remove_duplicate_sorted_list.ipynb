    "To solve the problem of removing duplicates from a sorted linked list, we can use a simple traversal approach. Since the list is already sorted, duplicate nodes will be adjacent to each other. Our task is to traverse the list, compare each node with the next one, and remove the duplicates by adjusting the pointers.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Steps to Implement the Solution\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Initialize a pointer** to the head of the list.\n",
    "2. **Traverse the list** using this pointer:\n",
    "   - Compare the current node with the next node.\n",
    "   - If they have the same value, skip the next node by adjusting the `next` pointer of the current node to skip the duplicate.\n",
    "   - Otherwise, move to the next node.\n",
    "3. **Continue this process** until the end of the list.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Implementation\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's the implementation of the above approach in Python:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Definition for singly-linked list.\n",
    "class ListNode:\n",
    "    def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):\n",
    "        self.val = val\n",
    "        self.next = next\n",
    "\n",
    "class Solution:\n",
    "    def deleteDuplicates(self, head: ListNode) -> ListNode:\n",
    "        # Start with the head of the list\n",
    "        current = head\n",
    "        \n",
    "        # Traverse the list\n",
    "        while current and current.next:\n",
    "            # Check if the current node and the next node have the same value\n",
    "            if current.val == current.next.val:\n",
    "                # Skip the next node by pointing to the one after it\n",
    "                current.next = current.next.next\n",
    "            else:\n",
    "                # Move to the next node\n",
    "                current = current.next\n",
    "        \n",
    "        # Return the modified list\n",
    "        return head\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Explanation of the Code\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **ListNode Class**: Defines the structure of a node in the linked list, with `val` representing the value and `next` pointing to the next node.\n",
    "   \n",
    "2. **deleteDuplicates Method**:\n",
    "   - We initialize `current` to the `head` of the list.\n",
    "   - The `while` loop checks both `current` and `current.next` to ensure there are nodes to compare.\n",
    "   - If `current.val` is equal to `current.next.val`, we skip the duplicate node by setting `current.next` to `current.next.next`.\n",
    "   - Otherwise, we move `current` to the next node.\n",
    "   - The loop continues until we reach the end of the list.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's see how this works with the input `[1,1,2,3,3]`:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Initial list: `1 -> 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 3`\n",
    "- After removing the first duplicate `1`: `1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 3`\n",
    "- After moving to `2`: no duplicates, move to `3`.\n",
    "- After removing the first duplicate `3`: `1 -> 2 -> 3`\n",
    "- Final output: `1 -> 2 -> 3`\n",
    "\n",
    "### Complexity Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the linked list. We traverse the list once.\n",
    "- **Space Complexity**: O(1), as we only use a few pointers without any extra space proportional to the input size.\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach effectively removes duplicates from a sorted linked list while maintaining its sorted order."
