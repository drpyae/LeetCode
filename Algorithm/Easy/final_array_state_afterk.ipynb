    "To solve this problem, we need to perform `k` operations on the array `nums` by repeatedly finding the minimum value, replacing it with its multiplied value, and repeating this process `k` times. Below is the approach to implement this:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Approach:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Identify the Minimum Value**:\n",
    "   - Find the minimum value in `nums`. If there are multiple occurrences of the minimum value, choose the one that appears first.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Replace with Multiplied Value**:\n",
    "   - Replace the identified minimum value with `min_value * multiplier`.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Repeat for k Operations**:\n",
    "   - Repeat steps 1 and 2 exactly `k` times.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Implementation:\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's the implementation based on the above steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class Solution:\n",
    "    def performOperations(self, nums: List[int], k: int, multiplier: int) -> List[int]:\n",
    "        # Perform k operations\n",
    "        for _ in range(k):\n",
    "            # Find the index of the first occurrence of the minimum value\n",
    "            min_index = nums.index(min(nums))\n",
    "            # Replace the minimum value with its multiplied value\n",
    "            nums[min_index] *= multiplier\n",
    "        return nums\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Explanation of the Code:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Loop through k times**:\n",
    "   - For each operation, find the minimum value in `nums` using the `min()` function and identify its first occurrence using the `index()` method.\n",
    "   \n",
    "2. **Replace and Multiply**:\n",
    "   - Multiply the identified minimum value by `multiplier` and replace it in the array.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Return the Final Array**:\n",
    "   - After completing all `k` operations, return the modified array `nums`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example Execution:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example 1:\n",
    "- **Input**: `nums = [2, 1, 3, 5, 6], k = 5, multiplier = 2`\n",
    "- **Output**: `[8, 4, 6, 5, 6]`\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step-by-Step Execution**:\n",
    "1. Initial state: `[2, 1, 3, 5, 6]`\n",
    "2. After 1st operation: Find `1` → Replace with `1 * 2` → `[2, 2, 3, 5, 6]`\n",
    "3. After 2nd operation: Find `2` → Replace with `2 * 2` → `[4, 2, 3, 5, 6]`\n",
    "4. After 3rd operation: Find `2` → Replace with `2 * 2` → `[4, 4, 3, 5, 6]`\n",
    "5. After 4th operation: Find `3` → Replace with `3 * 2` → `[4, 4, 6, 5, 6]`\n",
    "6. After 5th operation: Find `4` → Replace with `4 * 2` → `[8, 4, 6, 5, 6]`\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example 2:\n",
    "- **Input**: `nums = [1, 2], k = 3, multiplier = 4`\n",
    "- **Output**: `[16, 8]`\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step-by-Step Execution**:\n",
    "1. Initial state: `[1, 2]`\n",
    "2. After 1st operation: Find `1` → Replace with `1 * 4` → `[4, 2]`\n",
    "3. After 2nd operation: Find `2` → Replace with `2 * 4` → `[4, 8]`\n",
    "4. After 3rd operation: Find `4` → Replace with `4 * 4` → `[16, 8]`\n",
    "\n",
    "### Complexity Analysis:\n",
    "- **Time Complexity**: O(k * n), where `n` is the length of the array. Each operation involves finding the minimum, which takes O(n).\n",
    "- **Space Complexity**: O(1), as the operations are performed in place.\n",
    "\n",
    "This solution efficiently modifies the array based on the given constraints, making it suitable for the problem requirements."
