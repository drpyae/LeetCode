    "To solve this problem, we need to increment the large integer represented by the array `digits` by one and return the result as an array of digits.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Approach:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Start from the Rightmost Digit**:\n",
    "   - We start from the end of the array (the least significant digit) and attempt to add 1 to it.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Handle Carry Over**:\n",
    "   - If adding 1 to a digit causes it to become 10 (e.g., from 9 to 10), set the current digit to 0 and carry over 1 to the next significant digit to the left.\n",
    "   - Continue this process until there are no more digits left or no more carry is required.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Handle the Edge Case of Overflow**:\n",
    "   - If all the digits are `9`, the result will require an additional digit (e.g., `[9,9,9]` becomes `[1,0,0,0]`). In such a case, we prepend a `1` to the result array.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Python Implementation:\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's a Python function to implement the solution:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def plusOne(digits):\n",
    "    # Start from the last digit and iterate backwards\n",
    "    for i in range(len(digits) - 1, -1, -1):\n",
    "        # If the digit is less than 9, increment it and return the array\n",
    "        if digits[i] < 9:\n",
    "            digits[i] += 1\n",
    "            return digits\n",
    "        # If the digit is 9, set it to 0 and continue to the next digit\n",
    "        digits[i] = 0\n",
    "\n",
    "    # If we reach here, all the digits were 9 and we need an extra digit\n",
    "        if  i == 0\n",
    "            return [1] + digits\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example Walkthrough:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Example 1**:\n",
    "   - **Input**: `digits = [1,2,3]`\n",
    "   - **Process**:\n",
    "     - Start from the last digit (`3`), add `1` to it, resulting in `4`.\n",
    "     - No carry is needed, so the result is `[1,2,4]`.\n",
    "   - **Output**: `[1,2,4]`\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Example 2**:\n",
    "   - **Input**: `digits = [4,3,2,1]`\n",
    "   - **Process**:\n",
    "     - Start from the last digit (`1`), add `1` to it, resulting in `2`.\n",
    "     - No carry is needed, so the result is `[4,3,2,2]`.\n",
    "   - **Output**: `[4,3,2,2]`\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Example 3**:\n",
    "   - **Input**: `digits = [9]`\n",
    "   - **Process**:\n",
    "     - Start from the last digit (`9`), add `1` to it, resulting in `10`.\n",
    "     - Set the digit to `0` and carry `1` to the next position.\n",
    "     - No more digits to process, so prepend `1` to the result, resulting in `[1,0]`.\n",
    "   - **Output**: `[1,0]`\n",
    "\n",
    "### Complexity Analysis:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Time Complexity**: \\(O(n)\\), where `n` is the number of digits. In the worst case, we need to process all digits once.\n",
    "- **Space Complexity**: \\(O(1)\\) (excluding the input and output), since the solution modifies the input array in place, except in cases where the result requires an additional digit. \n",
    "\n",
    "This approach is efficient and handles all possible edge cases such as carrying over and the addition of extra digits."
