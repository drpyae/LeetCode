    "# Same Tree\n",
    "Given the roots of two binary trees p and q, write a function to check if they are the same or not.\n",

    "To determine whether two binary trees are the same, we need to compare their structure and node values. The trees are considered the same if they are structurally identical, and each corresponding node in the two trees has the same value.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Approach\n",
    "\n",
    "We can use a recursive approach or an iterative approach with a queue or stack to traverse both trees simultaneously. Here’s a recursive solution:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Base Cases**:\n",
    "   - If both trees are `None`, they are considered the same.\n",
    "   - If one tree is `None` and the other is not, they are not the same.\n",
    "   - If the values of the current nodes in both trees are different, they are not the same.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Recursive Step**:\n",
    "   - Recursively check the left and right subtrees of both trees.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Implementation\n",
    "\n",
    "Here’s the implementation of this approach using Python:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Definition for a binary tree node.\n",
    "class TreeNode:\n",
    "    def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):\n",
    "        self.val = val\n",
    "        self.left = left\n",
    "        self.right = right\n",
    "\n",
    "class Solution:\n",
    "    def isSameTree(self, p: TreeNode, q: TreeNode) -> bool:\n",
    "        # Base cases\n",
    "        if not p and not q:\n",
    "            return True\n",
    "        if not p or not q:\n",
    "            return False\n",
    "        if p.val != q.val:\n",
    "            return False\n",
    "        \n",
    "        # Recursive check for left and right subtrees\n",
    "        return self.isSameTree(p.left, q.left) and self.isSameTree(p.right, q.right)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Example usage:\n",
    "# Tree 1: [1, 2, 3]\n",
    "# Tree 2: [1, 2, 3]\n",
    "p = TreeNode(1, TreeNode(2), TreeNode(3))\n",
    "q = TreeNode(1, TreeNode(2), TreeNode(3))\n",
    "sol = Solution()\n",
    "print(sol.isSameTree(p, q))  # Output: True\n",
    "\n",
    "# Tree 1: [1, 2]\n",
    "# Tree 2: [1, null, 2]\n",
    "p = TreeNode(1, TreeNode(2))\n",
    "q = TreeNode(1, None, TreeNode(2))\n",
    "print(sol.isSameTree(p, q))  # Output: False\n",
    "\n",
    "# Tree 1: [1, 2, 1]\n",
    "# Tree 2: [1, 1, 2]\n",
    "p = TreeNode(1, TreeNode(2), TreeNode(1))\n",
    "q = TreeNode(1, TreeNode(1), TreeNode(2))\n",
    "print(sol.isSameTree(p, q))  # Output: False\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Explanation of the Code\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Class Definition**: `TreeNode` is used to represent nodes in a binary tree.\n",
    "2. **`isSameTree` Function**:\n",
    "   - The function compares the values of the nodes and checks the left and right subtrees recursively.\n",
    "3. **Base Cases**:\n",
    "   - If both nodes are `None`, they are considered the same.\n",
    "   - If only one is `None`, they are different.\n",
    "   - If their values differ, they are not the same.\n",
    "4. **Recursive Call**:\n",
    "   - Calls itself on the left and right children of the nodes.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Complexity\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Time Complexity**: \\( O(\\min(N, M)) \\), where \\( N \\) and \\( M \\) are the number of nodes in trees `p` and `q`, respectively. This is because each node is visited once.\n",
    "- **Space Complexity**: \\( O(\\min(H_p, H_q)) \\), where \\( H_p \\) and \\( H_q \\) are the heights of trees `p` and `q`. This is due to the recursive stack depth in the worst case.\n",
    "\n",
    "This implementation checks if two binary trees are identical in structure and node values, as required by the problem constraints."
