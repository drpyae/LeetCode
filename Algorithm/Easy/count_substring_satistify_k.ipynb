    "To solve the problem of finding the number of substrings in a binary string `s` that satisfy the `k-constraint`, we need to check every substring of `s` to see if it contains at most `k` occurrences of either `0`s or `1`s.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Approach:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Generate All Substrings**:\n",
    "   - We generate all possible substrings of `s`. A substring is defined by its starting and ending indices.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Check Each Substring for k-Constraint**:\n",
    "   - For each substring, count the number of `0`s and `1`s.\n",
    "   - Check if either the count of `0`s or `1`s is less than or equal to `k`.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Count Valid Substrings**:\n",
    "   - Count the substrings that satisfy the condition.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Detailed Steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Use two nested loops to generate all substrings:\n",
    "   - The outer loop defines the start index.\n",
    "   - The inner loop defines the end index.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. For each substring:\n",
    "   - Count the occurrences of `0`s and `1`s.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Check if the substring meets the constraint:\n",
    "   - If the count of `0`s or `1`s is less than or equal to `k`, add to the count of valid substrings.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Implementation:\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is the Python code implementing the above approach:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class Solution:\n",
    "    def countValidSubstrings(self, s: str, k: int) -> int:\n",
    "        n = len(s)\n",
    "        valid_count = 0\n",
    "        \n",
    "        # Iterate over all possible substrings\n",
    "        for start in range(n):\n",
    "            zeros = 0\n",
    "            ones = 0\n",
    "            \n",
    "            for end in range(start, n):\n",
    "                # Count zeros and ones in the current substring\n",
    "                if s[end] == '0':\n",
    "                    zeros += 1\n",
    "                else:\n",
    "                    ones += 1\n",
    "                \n",
    "                # Check if the current substring meets the k-constraint\n",
    "                if zeros <= k or ones <= k:\n",
    "                    valid_count += 1\n",
    "                else:\n",
    "                    # If the condition is violated, break early\n",
    "                    break\n",
    "        \n",
    "        return valid_count\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Explanation of the Code:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Outer Loop**:\n",
    "   - Iterates through each possible starting index of the substring.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Inner Loop**:\n",
    "   - Expands the substring by moving the end index.\n",
    "   - Counts the number of `0`s and `1`s in the current substring.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Validation**:\n",
    "   - If the substring meets the `k-constraint`, increment the valid count.\n",
    "   - If not, break out of the inner loop as expanding the substring further will only increase the counts.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Complexity Analysis:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Time Complexity**: O(n^2), where n is the length of the string. This is because we are checking every possible substring.\n",
    "- **Space Complexity**: O(1), as no additional space proportional to the input size is used.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example Execution:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example 1:\n",
    "- **Input**: `s = \"10101\"`, `k = 1`\n",
    "- **Output**: `12`\n",
    "\n",
    "Explanation:\n",
    "- The substrings `\"1010\"`, `\"10101\"`, and `\"0101\"` do not satisfy the `k-constraint`. All other substrings do.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example 2:\n",
    "- **Input**: `s = \"1010101\"`, `k = 2`\n",
    "- **Output**: `25`\n",
    "\n",
    "Explanation:\n",
    "- Substrings longer than length 5 do not satisfy the `k-constraint`. All others do.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example 3:\n",
    "- **Input**: `s = \"11111\"`, `k = 1`\n",
    "- **Output**: `15`\n",
    "\n",
    "Explanation:\n",
    "- All substrings satisfy the `k-constraint`.\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach ensures that each substring is evaluated efficiently, and the conditions of the `k-constraint` are checked accurately."
