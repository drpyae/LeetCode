    "This problem is a classic example of the Fibonacci sequence. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Explanation\n",
    "\n",
    "To determine how many distinct ways you can climb to the top of a staircase of `n` steps where you can either take 1 step or 2 steps at a time, let's analyze the steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **If you have 1 step (`n = 1`)**: There is only 1 way to reach the top â€” taking 1 step.\n",
    "- **If you have 2 steps (`n = 2`)**: There are 2 ways to reach the top:\n",
    "  1. Take 1 step + 1 step.\n",
    "  2. Take 2 steps in one go.\n",
    "\n",
    "For any number of steps greater than 2, we can observe that:\n",
    "\n",
    "- To reach the `n`th step, you could have:\n",
    "  - Come from the `n-1`th step by taking 1 step.\n",
    "  - Come from the `n-2`th step by taking 2 steps.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, the number of ways to reach the `n`th step is the sum of the ways to reach the `(n-1)`th step and the ways to reach the `(n-2)`th step.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is exactly the Fibonacci sequence:\n",
    "\\[\n",
    "\\text{ways}(n) = \\text{ways}(n-1) + \\text{ways}(n-2)\n",
    "\\]\n",
    "\n",
    "### Approach\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Base Cases**:\n",
    "   - If `n = 1`, return `1`.\n",
    "   - If `n = 2`, return `2`.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Recursive Formula**:\n",
    "   For `n > 2`, use the formula:\n",
    "   \\[\n",
    "   \\text{ways}(n) = \\text{ways}(n-1) + \\text{ways}(n-2)\n",
    "   \\]\n",
    "\n",
    "### Dynamic Programming Solution\n",
    "\n",
    "We can use dynamic programming to compute this efficiently.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Python Code\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def climbStairs(n: int) -> int:\n",
    "    # Base cases\n",
    "    if n == 1:\n",
    "        return 1\n",
    "    if n == 2:\n",
    "        return 2\n",
    "\n",
    "    # Dynamic Programming array to store ways to reach each step\n",
    "    dp = [0] * (n + 1)\n",
    "    dp[1] = 1  # 1 way to reach step 1\n",
    "    dp[2] = 2  # 2 ways to reach step 2\n",
    "\n",
    "    # Fill the DP array\n",
    "    for i in range(3, n + 1):\n",
    "        dp[i] = dp[i - 1] + dp[i - 2]\n",
    "\n",
    "    return dp[n]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Space-Optimized Solution\n",
    "\n",
    "Since we only need the last two values to compute the current value, we can reduce the space complexity to \\(O(1)\\) by keeping track of the last two results.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Optimized Python Code\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def climbStairs(n: int) -> int:\n",
    "    if n == 1:\n",
    "        return 1\n",
    "    if n == 2:\n",
    "        return 2\n",
    "\n",
    "    # Initialize the first two steps\n",
    "    a, b = 1, 2\n",
    "\n",
    "    # Iterate to find the nth step\n",
    "    for _ in range(3, n + 1):\n",
    "        a, b = b, a + b\n",
    "\n",
    "    return b\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Complexity Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Time Complexity**: \\(O(n)\\) because we are iterating from 3 to `n`.\n",
    "- **Space Complexity**: \\(O(1)\\) in the optimized solution because we only use two variables to store the last two results.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Examples\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Input**: `n = 2`  \n",
    "   **Output**: `2`  \n",
    "   **Explanation**: Two ways to reach the top: (1 step + 1 step) or (2 steps).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Input**: `n = 3`  \n",
    "   **Output**: `3`  \n",
    "   **Explanation**: Three ways to reach the top: (1 step + 1 step + 1 step), (1 step + 2 steps), or (2 steps + 1 step).  \n",
    "\n",
    "This solution efficiently calculates the number of distinct ways to climb to the top of a staircase of `n` steps."
