    "# Most Stones Removed with Same Row or Column\n",
    "On a 2D plane, we place n stones at some integer coordinate points. Each coordinate point may have at most one stone.\n",
    "\n",
    "A stone can be removed if it shares either the same row or the same column as another stone that has not been removed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given an array stones of length n where stones[i] = [xi, yi] represents the location of the ith stone, return the largest possible number of stones that can be removed.\n",
    "\n",
    " \n",
    "\n",
    "Example 1:\n",
    "\n",
    "Input: stones = [[0,0],[0,1],[1,0],[1,2],[2,1],[2,2]]\n",
    "Output: 5\n",
    "Explanation: One way to remove 5 stones is as follows:\n",
    "1. Remove stone [2,2] because it shares the same row as [2,1].\n",
    "2. Remove stone [2,1] because it shares the same column as [0,1].\n",
    "3. Remove stone [1,2] because it shares the same row as [1,0].\n",
    "4. Remove stone [1,0] because it shares the same column as [0,0].\n",
    "5. Remove stone [0,1] because it shares the same row as [0,0].\n",
    "Stone [0,0] cannot be removed since it does not share a row/column with another stone still on the plane.\n",
    "Example 2:\n",
    "\n",
    "Input: stones = [[0,0],[0,2],[1,1],[2,0],[2,2]]\n",
    "Output: 3\n",

    "Stones [0,0] and [1,1] cannot be removed since they do not share a row/column with another stone still on the plane.\n",
    "Example 3:\n",
    "\n",
    "Input: stones = [[0,0]]\n",
    "Output: 0\n",

    "### Explanation of the Code\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Union-Find Class**:\n",
    "   - `find(x)`: Uses path compression to find the root of `x`. If `x` is not its own parent, it recursively finds the root and assigns it to `x` to flatten the tree.\n",
    "   - `union(x, y)`: Unites the sets that `x` and `y` belong to. It uses union by rank to attach the smaller tree under the root of the deeper tree to keep the trees balanced.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **removeStones Method**:\n",
    "   - The `removeStones` method initializes the Union-Find data structure.\n",
    "   - It loops through each stone and connects it to other stones that are in the same row or column by performing union operations. The use of `~y` is a trick to differentiate between rows and columns, allowing them to share the same Union-Find structure.\n",
    "   - After processing all the stones, it calculates the number of unique components by finding all unique roots.\n",
    "   - The number of stones that can be removed is the total number of stones minus the number of unique components.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example Usage\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Example usage\n",
    "solution = Solution()\n",
    "\n",
    "stones1 = [[0, 0], [0, 1], [1, 0], [1, 2], [2, 1], [2, 2]]\n",
    "print(solution.removeStones(stones1))  # Output: 5\n",
    "\n",
    "stones2 = [[0, 0], [0, 2], [1, 1], [2, 0], [2, 2]]\n",
    "print(solution.removeStones(stones2))  # Output: 3\n",
    "\n",
    "stones3 = [[0, 0]]\n",
    "print(solution.removeStones(stones3))  # Output: 0\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Complexity Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Time Complexity**: O(n \\* α(n)), where n is the number of stones and α is the inverse Ackermann function. The time complexity is nearly linear due to the use of path compression and union by rank.\n",
    "- **Space Complexity**: O(n), for storing the parent and rank information in the Union-Find structure."
