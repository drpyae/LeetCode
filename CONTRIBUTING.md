# Contributing to Data Structures and Algorithms Repository

First of all, thanks for taking the time to contribute! ðŸŽ‰ Your help is greatly appreciated, whether you're fixing a bug, adding a new data structure, or improving the documentation.

## How to Contribute

### 1. Fork the Repository

Fork the repository to your own GitHub account by clicking the "Fork" button at the top right corner of the repository page.

### 2. Clone the Forked Repository

Clone the forked repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/repository-name.git
```

Replace `your-username` and `repository-name` with your GitHub username and the name of the repository.

### 3. Create a New Branch

Create a new branch from the `main` branch for your changes:

```bash
git checkout -b your-branch-name
```

Use a descriptive branch name that reflects the purpose of your changes, such as `add-binary-search`, `fix-merge-sort-bug`, or `improve-readme`.

### 4. Make Your Changes

Make your changes to the codebase. Ensure your code:

- Follows the existing coding style and structure.
- Includes comments and is well-documented.
- Includes test cases where applicable.

### 5. Commit Your Changes

Commit your changes with a descriptive commit message:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Add binary search implementation in Python"
```

### 6. Push to Your Fork

Push your changes to your forked repository:

```bash
git push origin your-branch-name
```

### 7. Create a Pull Request

Go to the original repository on GitHub and click "New Pull Request." Select your branch and describe your changes in detail.

### 8. Address Review Comments

Your pull request will be reviewed by the maintainers. Make sure to address any feedback and update your pull request accordingly.

## Guidelines for Contributing

1. **Code of Conduct**: Be respectful and considerate of others. Please read and adhere to our [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).
   
2. **Naming Conventions**: Use meaningful names for files and functions. For example:
    - Files: `binary_search.py`, `merge_sort.java`.
    - Functions: `binarySearch()`, `mergeSort()`.

3. **Documentation**: All contributions must include proper documentation:
    - Include a brief explanation of the algorithm or data structure.
    - Mention the time and space complexity of the algorithm.

4. **Testing**: Ensure your code works as expected and write test cases for the new algorithms or data structures.

5. **Language Support**: You can contribute in any programming language. Ensure the language is clearly specified in the folder structure (e.g., `Python/binary_search.py`).

6. **Avoid Duplicate Content**: Check the existing implementations before contributing to avoid duplicate code. If you want to improve an existing implementation, describe how your contribution is different.
